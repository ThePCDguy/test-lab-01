            <p>
                    In 1912, he started his own business in Mwanza initially on a small scale and which continued to progress with time finally resulting in a significant business empire. 
                    He started trading in commodities such as grain, rice, wax and animal hides. 
                    This soon expanded to the establishment of rice mills and coffee mills. 
                    Soon after he leased cotton ginning factory and cotton-seed oil producing mill.
                    Whilst most of the community businessmen were just interested in cotton ginneries to sort the cotton, Ladhabhai was greatly involved in cotton growing and improving the quality of the cotton by promoting better agricultural methods. 
                    He used to travel to all the districts including Ukerewe and reward the farmers who produced better cotton and because of his efforts Mwanza district became the foremost producer of quality cotton. 
                    His business adventures took him to purchase 2 gold mines around the Buckreef region not too far from Geita. 
                    Today, the second largest gold mines in Africa are situated there.
